# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document


This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.


Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction


//In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.//
The "Taskman" is a comprehensive task management tool that empowers users to effortlessly create and modify tasks while offering additional functionalities like extension and prioritization. This app allows users to seamlessly prioritize their daily and even long-term tasks, ensuring improved completion rates.


By utilizing "Taskman", users can bid farewell to the practice of jotting down notes that often get misplaced or deleted, including important grocery lists. The application serves as a reliable digital assistant, allowing users to maintain a structured approach to their tasks, boosting productivity and reducing chaos in their busy lives.


The user of this application can be anyone. This system's primary target audience is students or any young corporate worker seeking an efficient application to alleviate the challenges of managing their overwhelming schedules. "Taskman" is designed to bring order and manageability to their lives, streamlining their task management process, and providing a much-needed sense of organization and control.

## Constraints


In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.


- ** Constraint 1** HS : The task management system should be accessible through popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.


- ** Constraint 2** HS : The task management should be compatible with common operating systems like Windows, macOS and Linux.


- ** Constraint 3** ZK : The applications functionality may not be cohesive the way our team is envisioning 


- ** Constraint 4** ZK: Completing all the task for this project might not be possible due to the short window of time before the deadline 


- ** Constraint 5** HT: The app must ensure the security and privacy of user data, especially when handling sensitive information such as task details and attachments


- ** Constraint 6** HT: Optimize the app’s performance to ensure smooth and responsive task management


- ** Constraint 7** SM: The application may not be able to visualize all functions due to limited time working on the project.


- ** Constraint 8** SM: Application creation requires utilization of Flask, as well as Python, HTML, CSS, and may also include instances of mySQL, but this indicates that we may or may not be able to touch every detail in the major functions of the program.

- **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.
